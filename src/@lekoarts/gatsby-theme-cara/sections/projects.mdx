  Local consumers form the fabric of our communities – and 1 in 8 shop with SNAP benefits. They’re a critical source of growth for small grocers, markets, and cafes. But can your customers easily spend EBT dollars at your business?

  Government benefits like SNAP, WIC, and TANF are a critical form of local economic power. Every $1 in EBT sales generates up to $1.80 in economic activity. But it’s important that these dollars stay in the communities that receive them.

By empowering small businesses to accept EBT online and in person, we can return millions of dollars to local communities. That’s why we’re on a mission to make public benefits work for all, putting economic power back in the hands of the people.
