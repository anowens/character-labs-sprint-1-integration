##Small Business
Small businesses have long been the backbone of the American economy but they often have to struggle to compete with mega–corporations – especially for EBT spending. Massive retailers like Amazon and Walmart receive 80% of EBT dollars, sucking valuable economic stimulus away from small business owners. It’s time to change that reality by making public benefits a hand up for all. 

##Local Consumers
Local consumers form the fabric of our communities – and 1 in 8 shop with SNAP benefits. They’re a critical source of growth for small grocers, markets, and cafes. But can your customers easily spend EBT dollars at your business? 

##Government Benefits
Government benefits like SNAP, WIC, and TANF are a critical form of local economic power. Every $1 in EBT sales generates up to $1.80 in economic activity. But it’s important that these dollars stay in the communities that receive them. 

##Technology
Through tech innovation, dyndryt knows that we can make EBT processing easier. By empowering small businesses to accept EBT online and in person, we can return millions of dollars to local communities. That’s why we’re on a mission to make public benefits work for all, putting economic power back in the hands of the people.
