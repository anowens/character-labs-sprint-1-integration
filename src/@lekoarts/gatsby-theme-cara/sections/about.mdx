## How it works

> 1. Get FNS approved to accept EBT.
If you’re not already approved, dyndryt will guide you through USDA (FNS) authorization and help with application details.


> 2. Set up with dyndryt.
We work with you to integrate EBT processing into your online and in–person customer experience. 

> 3. Start receiving payments.
Going forward, we provide you with detailed sales reporting and keep you up to date with FNS compliance and market advances.
